Zoinks (_**Zo**tero **in**formation quic**k** **s**earch_) is a command-line utility that returns the values of selected fields of a bibliographic record given a Zotero select link, an item key, or even the path to a file attachment in your Zotero database.

Introduction
------------

> "Shaggy has a characteristic speech pattern, marked by his frequent use of the filler word "like" and, when startled, his exclamations of "**Zoinks**!" &mdash; _from the Wikipedia entry for [Shaggy Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_Rogers), retrieved on 2020-12-15. An [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112011139/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_Rogers) is available in the Wayback Machine._

When using [Zotero](https://zotero.org) in scripts and other software, you may need a way to retrieve information about bibliographic entries without searching for them in Zotero itself.  _Zoinks_ (a loose acronym for _**Zo**tero **in**formation quic**k **s**earch_) is a program that lets you do this from the command line.

Zoinks is a companion to [Zowie](https://github.com/mhucka/zowie), a command-line application that writes Zotero select links into PDF files to make them accessible outside of Zotero.
